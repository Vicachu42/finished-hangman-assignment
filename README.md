# Hangman-assignment

Hangman assignment for semester 1 of Frontend Dev.

While everything works the way it should, there are some features I would add if I had more time and mental energy.

The first would be a way to display only the underlines and not the questions marks in the start of the game. I tried some different methods to solve the problem, like leaving it empty, layering another underline and masking it, and different methods to create an empty space.

The other would be to add a way to remove the generated word from the array after creating a new game, and then reset the array once you've played all the words. I have done functions like these before, but I don't have the energy to try and implement them here.

Timed function? Another time (lol).
